# üëá My Simple Rules in This Repository

<br></br>

## 1. üôÄ Do Not Use an IDE while Learning Python 

<details>
    <summary>
        It may not be the best idea to be using an IDE...
    </summary>
        Relying on an IDE means that you can‚Äôt work with new programming languages until some company decides to sell you an IDE for that language. This means you can‚Äôt use that new language until the language is large enough to justify a lucrative customer base. If you are confident you can work with only a programmer‚Äôs text editor (like Vim, Emacs, Atom, etc.) then you don‚Äôt have to wait for a third party. IDEs are nice in some situations (such as working with a giant existing code base) but being addicted to them will limit your future. You should also not use IDLE. It has serious limitations in how it works and isn‚Äôt a very good piece of software. All you need is a simple text editor, a shell, and Python.

## 2. ü§î Do Not Copy-Paste

<details>
    <summary>
        You must type each of these exercises in, manually...
    </summary>
        If you copy-paste, you might as well not even do them. The point of these exercises is to train your hands, your brain, and your mind in how to read, write, and see code. If you copy-paste, you are cheating yourself out of the effectiveness of the lessons.

## 3. üìà Practice and Persistence

<details>
    <summary>
        Repetitive practice is natural and just how to learn something...
    </summary>
        I know that to get good at anything I have to practice every day, even if I suck that day (which is often) or it‚Äôs difficult. Keep trying, and eventually it‚Äôll be easier and fun. If you give up, you won‚Äôt ever reach this point. You will hit the first confusing thing (which is everything at first) and then stop. If you keep trying, keep typing it in, keep trying to understand it and reading about it, you will eventually get it.

## `Table of Contents`

### [`1. Python Programming Excercise`](https://github.com/jinkyukim-me/Learn-Python-Programming/tree/master/exercises)
<details>
    <summary>
        This section is meant to get you started in programming...
    </summary>
        Instruction is where I tell you to do a sequence of controlled exercises designed to build a skill through repetition. This technique works very well with beginners who know nothing and need to acquire basic skills before they can understand more complex topics. It‚Äôs used in everything from martial arts to music to even basic math and reading skills. This book instructs you in Python by slowly building and establishing skills through techniques such as practice and memorization, then applying them to increasingly difficult problems. By the end of the book you will have the tools needed to begin learning more complex programming topics. I like to tell people that my book gives you your ‚Äúprogramming black belt.‚Äù What this means is that you know the basics well enough to now start learning programming. If you work hard, take your time, and build these skills, you will learn to code.

# Learn Python Programming
---
파이썬 책과 레퍼런스에서 공부한 내용들을 다루고 있습니다.
개념에서 크게 벗어나지 않는 선에서 원래의 소스 코드에서 이해를 위해 다른 방식으로 작성을 하였습니다.

주석은 한글로 되어있고, 코드를 따라가다보면 기초 개념부터 응용까지 연습해보실 수 있을 겁니다. 
매일매일 업데이트 하도록 노력하겠으니, 많이 참고해 주시면 감사하겠습니다.

        Instruction is where I tell you to do a sequence of controlled exercises designed to build a skill through repetition. This technique works very well with beginners who know nothing and need to acquire basic skills before they can understand more complex topics. It’s used in everything from martial arts to music to even basic math and reading skills. This book instructs you in Python by slowly building and establishing skills through techniques such as practice and memorization, then applying them to increasingly difficult problems. By the end of the book you will have the tools needed to begin learning more complex programming topics. I like to tell people that my book gives you your “programming black belt.” What this means is that you know the basics well enough to now start learning programming. If you work hard, take your time, and build these skills, you will learn to code.
